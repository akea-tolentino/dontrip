## Technologies

**don'trip** is a web application built on the **MERN* stack. MongoDB and Express comprises the backend, while React/Node.js comprise the frontend. Using a NoSQL database such as MongoDB allows us more freedom in how we express the relationships between data objects. React and Node.js let us create an interactive and dynamic webpage.

### API usage:

- AWS
- ChatGPT API
```
   const apiRequestBody = {
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "messages": [{
                "role": "user",
                "content": `return only a string of 5 ${experience} destinations in ${category}, located in North America, South America, Europe, or Asia, formatted in city, country, and coordinates using the World Geodetic System WGS84 standard", split by a |, on a single line, Donâ€™t justify your answers. `
            }],
            "temperature": 0,
            "max_tokens": 1000
        };
```

## Technical challenges:

- Formatting ChatGPT queries to return responses in a usable format that can be passed back into our code
